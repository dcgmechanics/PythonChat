# PythonChat
This Is a Small Chat Program Written In Python.
Here I've Used Socket Module. All You Need Is To Specify The IP Address In The Server Python File & When Using The CLient Python File You Need To Use That Server IP Address.

There Are 3 Versions:

1) Server.py : It Is Basically LAN Chat Application Written In Python.
2) Server_Log.py : It Is Base Version LAN Chat Application Written In Python With Log Features, Means All The Chats Will Be Saved as the LOG in the Hard Drive.
3) Server_Multi.py : It Is Base Version LAN Chat Application Written In Python With Multi Threading Support For Better Performance.

That's All.

Happy Chating :)
